# Customer Segmentation using Unsupervised Machine Learning

This project aims to segment customers based on their purchasing behavior using unsupervised learning techniques. The dataset is derived from a marketing campaign, and the goal is to identify distinct customer groups that can be targeted with personalized marketing strategies.

## 📁 Repository Structure

- `EDA.ipynb`: Exploratory Data Analysis including data cleaning, visualization, and initial insights.
- `Feature_engineering_and_clustering.ipynb`: Feature engineering steps and application of clustering algorithms such as KMeans.
- `Feature_Selection_and_classification.ipynb`: Feature selection process and evaluation using classification for validation purposes.
- `marketing_campaign.csv`: Original dataset used for customer profiling.
- `clustered_data.csv`: Final dataset with assigned cluster labels.

## 🧠 Techniques Used

- **Data Preprocessing**: Handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, scaling.
- **Feature Engineering**: Creation of meaningful features from raw data.
- **Unsupervised Learning**:
  - KMeans Clustering
  - Hierarchical Clustering
- **EDA**: Correlation analysis, distribution plots, and outlier detection.

## 📊 Objectives

- Group customers into segments with similar behaviors.
- Understand key attributes that define each cluster.
- Provide actionable insights for targeted marketing strategies.

## 📌 Key Libraries

- `pandas`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`
- `scikit-learn`
- `plotly` (for interactive visualizations)


## 📈 Outcomes
Identified distinct customer segments with differing spending habits.

Cluster insights provide strategic directions for personalized marketing.

Enhanced business understanding through data-driven customer profiling.
